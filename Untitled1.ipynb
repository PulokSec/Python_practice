Whether people engage in light exercise, such as going for a walk, or high intensity activities, for example, uphill cycling or weight training, regular exercise provides a huge range of benefits for the body and mind. Taking part in exercise of any intensity every day is essential for preventing a range of diseases and other health issues.

Most aerobic exercise takes place at average levels of intensity over longer periods. An aerobic exercise session involves warming up, exercising for at least 20 minutes, and then cooling down.

However, it is more effective than aerobic exercise for building muscle and improving strength. Increasing muscle mass causes the body to burn more fat, even when resting. Muscle is the most efficient tissue for burning fat in the body. Agility training Agility training aims to improve a person’s ability to maintain control while speeding up, slowing down, and changing direction. In tennis, for example, agility training helps a player maintain control over their court positioning through good recovery after each shot. People who take part in sports that heavily rely on positioning, coordination, speed, and balance need to engage in agility training regularly.

Some exercises combine stretching, muscle conditioning, and balance training. A popular and effective example is yoga. Yoga movements improve balance, flexibility, posture, and circulation. The practice originated in India thousands of years ago and aims to unify the mind, body, and spirit. Modern yoga uses a combination of meditation, posture, and breathing exercises to achieve the same goals. A yoga practitioner can tailor a course for individual needs. A person looking to manage arthritis might need gentle stretches to improve mobility and function. Someone with depression, on the other hand, may need more emphasis on the relaxation and deep breathing elements of yoga. Pilates is another stretching option that promotes flexibility and core strength. Tai chi is also an effective option for exercise that promotes calm stretching rather than intensity.
